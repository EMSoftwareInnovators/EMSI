                    <p>Beginning in early 2015, the original concept for EM Software innovators came from a computer programming meetup in a small town in Georgia. Although the meetup declined in patrons over the following months, the ones who did stay were devoted to learning how to make interesting and innovative computer programs and mobile apps that would change the world. Thus, EM Software Innovators was born.</p>
                    <!--p>As the years have progressed, the level of detail and complexity in our programs have increased dramatically. This is an effect of going outside our small town to a makerspace that is specialized in computer programming, theClubhou.se. This makerspace gave us the ability to meet with other like-minded individuals and learn from their endeavors. Although EM Software Innovators is still primarily run by only a couple of people, the coworking environment that theClubhou.se provides allows us to have the experience of a much larger company.</p-->

                    <p>Fact: EM Software Innovators is not the only company that spawned from our local meetup. The host of this meetup, who assists with development with EM Software Innovators' programs, also has a company, AugustaApps. If you need fun and educational programs designed with young children in mind, please check out his site here.</p>
